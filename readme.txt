The fastest, easiest, and best way to monetize your website.

== Description ==
LinkPay.io is the easiest and the least disrupting way to monetize your WordPress.  It's based on the LinkPay.io URL shortener (https://linkpay.io).

The biggest profit of using LinkPay.io is that it doesn't need a single pixel on your website, so it won't be cluttered with another banner advertisement.

All you need to do is to signup for LinkPay.io (https://linkpay.io/register.php), install our plugin and configure it by entering your API key which is accessible after registration.

Key advantages: - no advertising space on page needed - easy to install - easy to configure - high payout rates - shortened links.
